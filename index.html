        <h1>M Davis | About me</h1>
        <h2> Ambition </h2>
        <p>Learn to code well, and then try to make to world a better place by developing socially enterprising software, either for a social enterprise, or as a freelance developer.</p>
        <h2> Skills </h2>
        <ul><li>First class degree in physics from Durham University</li>
            <li>A wide and varied range of coding experience both taught and self-taught:
              <ul><li>Learnt Python at University to a level of building a version of 'Conways' game of life' and plotting the orbits of celestial objects from positional data for my final year project. </li>
                <li>Taught myself some C++ and flash, developing some (very) simple games.</li>
                <li>At the same time I learnt some basic HTML and CSS in order to build a website for the business of the parent of a friend. <li>
                <li>Have been using the CodeAcademy.com to begin learning the fullstack program - I completed the Ruby section as well as the html and CSS sections, although I already had some knowledge of the front end languages.</li>
                <li>Similarly I have done some learning on FreeCodeCamp.com, which I only discovered after CodeAcademy, although I think I now prefer it</li>
                <li>Reached 5 Kyu on CodeWars in under a month, mostly in JavaScript as a way of teaching myself that language</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Experience in volunteering and humanitarian work</li>
            <li>Quite a good cook</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Motivation </h2>
        <p>After I left university I travelled quite a lot, and in the summer of 2015 I spent 3 months in Zambia on a volunteering program. This involved working in local businesses with a Zambian counterpart, effectively as consultants for the  business. Additionally, in August 2016, I volunteered in the "<em>Jungle</em>"" refugee camp in Calais for a few weeks with friends who had been out there for much longer. During both of these experiences I often felt frustrated at not being able to put the skills I knew I had to better use. While I could certainly provide aid by driving vans full of essentials to the camp, was there not more I could do, using my analytical and scientific mind to help in different kind of way. While in Calais, we used an application called KoBo toolbox, an opensource, data collecting app developed especially for difficult circumstances, such as in humanitarian efforts. We used this in camp to record essential items refugees needed on our smart phones, and this was then uploaded to a database which others back in the warehouse could access. This allowed the distribution process to happen much faster, compared to the old way of going out, getting a hand written list then coming back to the warehouse to pack it all. After discovering the app and its uses I immediately realised this was exactly the kind of thing I wanted to help create, or develop, that can really have a big, direct impact in these sort of situations, and I am fairly sure that I would be good at doing so.</p>
